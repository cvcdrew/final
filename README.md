completing this exam has given me more insight on how AI can be used to help better complete my work. The goal is not to fully rely on the AI assistant but to just let it give you a path to follow and make the work easier.My project is complete and i have devided my repository into 5 files. the first file is the "conversation_Log" file which contains all the Prompts i made with the AI assistant which helped me step by step until the end of the project. The "main notebook" contains all my responses for this exam from beginning to the end including my text and also code. The "task_manager" contains the function for the task manager application whilst the "weather_fetcher" contains the updated code for the Weatherwise API which should be opened in google colab.
