        "Each stage of refinement significantly boosted the effectiveness of the task manager as well as the user experience of our clients. The initial version provided a basic framework, but some basic enhancements turned it into a far more resilient and user-friendly application.\n",
        "The first refinement was very impactful and crucial in the development of this application. The first pseudocode had some reliability concerns in the error handling sense. I improved it with graceful error handling for instances where there is a missing file where it will give the “FileNotFoundError” and also for invalid user input like, non-numeric menu choices or task numbers, handled with “ValueError”\n",
        "The second refinement elevated the program from being basic to being a more interesting and comprehensive application by introducing options like “complete task” and “View statistic”.

        "Here are three problems with the safe_weather_data_fetch() function's error handling, explained in terms of basic try/except principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Catch-All\" except Block is Too Broad:\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem: The function uses a simple except: without specifying what kind of error it's trying to catch. In an introductory course, while we learn the basic syntax of try and except, we also quickly learn that catching any error like this is problematic.\n",
        "Why it's an issue (basic terms): This except block will silently catch any problem that occurs inside the try block – whether it's a network issue, the website sending back something unexpected, or even a typo in your code. It then just returns the generic \"Error occurred\" message. This makes it very hard to figure out why the error happened, as you get no specific clue about the actual problem (e.g., \"internet disconnected\" vs. \"website sent bad data\"). Even with basic try/except, the goal is usually to provide some meaningful feedback.\n",
        "Hiding Specific Data Access Errors (e.g., Missing Information):\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem: Inside the try block, the code directly tries to access specific pieces of information from the data (like data['current_condition'][0]['temp_C']). If the API response doesn't contain these exact keys or indices, Python would normally raise a KeyError (for missing dictionary keys) or an IndexError (for trying to access a list item that doesn't exist).\n",
        "Why it's an issue (basic terms): Because of the \"catch-all\" except, these specific and common errors are also hidden. Instead of telling you, \"Hey, the 'temperature' data wasn't found in the response!\", it just gives the vague \"Error occurred.\" Even in a basic course, we learn about these specific error types, and it's better practice to at least be aware that they could happen and to provide a slightly more descriptive message if they do.\n",
        "No Distinction Between Connection Problems and Data Problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem: The requests.get(url) call (which handles connecting to the website) and the subsequent response.json() call (which handles parsing the data) are both within the same try block and caught by the same generic except.\n",
        "Why it's an issue (basic terms): This means the function can't tell the difference between \"I couldn't even connect to the weather service\" and \"I connected, but the weather data I received was in a format I couldn't understand.\" A basic approach to error handling would encourage thinking about these different stages of potential failure to give more helpful feedback to the user about what went wrong.\n",
